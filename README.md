# Malay Basin CO2 storage
## Introduction
This repository contains Python scripts, text files and raster files to accompany the journal article: "Regional screening of saline aquifers in the Malay Basin for CO2 storage", authored by Iain de Jonge-Anderson, Hariharan Ramachandran, Ana Widyanita, Andreas Busch, Florian Doster and Uisdean Nicholson
## Loading the raster grids
- Raster grids are presented in .bil format which can be readily imported into GIS software (e.g. ArcGIS). The projection used is Kertau 48N EPSG 24548.
- It was necessary to downsample the grids by half, from the grids presented in the manuscript, to reduce filesize
